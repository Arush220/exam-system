# 📘 Decentralized Exam System

## 📌 Project Title
**Decentralized Exam System using Blockchain and Smart Contracts**

---

## 📄 Project Description
The Decentralized Exam System is a blockchain-based application that enables secure, tamper-proof, and transparent management of online examinations. It allows administrators to create exams, students to submit answers, and ensures exam integrity by leveraging Ethereum smart contracts.

---

## 🎯 Project Vision
To revolutionize the examination process by providing a decentralized and transparent platform that ensures trust, prevents fraud, and automates key administrative tasks — all without relying on a centralized authority.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- 👨‍🏫 **Admin Control**: Only the contract deployer (admin) can create, update, and close exams.
- 📝 **Exam Creation**: Admin can define exams with an IPFS hash of the question set, start time, and duration.
- 📥 **Secure Submissions**: Students can submit their hashed answers during the active time window.
- 🔒 **Immutable Records**: Submissions and exam data are stored permanently on the blockchain.
- 🕵️‍♂️ **Exam Detail Retrieval**: Anyone can view exam metadata like duration, start time, and status.
- ✅ **Student Submission Check**: Verify whether a student has already submitted their answer.
- 🔄 **Exam Update**: Admin can modify exam time details before it starts.
- ❌ **Exam Deletion**: Admin can delete closed/inactive exams.
- 🔎 **Answer Review**: Admin can retrieve and review specific student submissions.

---

## 🚀 Future Scope

- 🎓 **Student Registration & Authentication** using decentralized identity (DID)
- 🧠 **Automated Answer Evaluation** using on-chain/off-chain AI logic
- 🪪 **NFT-based Certificates** for exam completion
- 📊 **Analytics Dashboard** for performance tracking
- 💬 **Decentralized Dispute System** for student queries
- 🌐 **Multi-language and Internationalization Support**

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Smart Contract Language**: Solidity
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum (compatible with any EVM-based network)
- **Frontend (future scope)**: React.js + Web3.js / Ethers.js
- **Storage (for questions/answers)**: IPFS or Filecoin

---

## 👨‍💻 Developer Notes

- Make sure to use a testnet (like Goerli or Mumbai) before deploying on mainnet.
- Smart contract should be compiled using Solidity `^0.8.0`.
- Integrate with Metamask for frontend interactions.
- Time-based constraints rely on the Unix timestamp (`block.timestamp`).
